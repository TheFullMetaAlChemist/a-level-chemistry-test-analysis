        },
        "b": {
          "question": "Explain why an indicator is used in this reaction.",
          "answer": "An indicator is used because both the acid and the base are colourless; it changes colour at the endpoint of the titration, indicating that neutralisation is complete.",
          "hint": "Consider how, in a colourless solution, it is difficult to identify the end-point. An indicator provides a visual cue when the acid has been neutralised."

        "c": {
          "question": "Describe how the student could obtain pure, dry crystals of sodium sulfate from the reaction mixture.",
          "answer": "The student should titrate with an indicator to determine the endpoint, then repeat the reaction without the indicator using the correct volumes, gently heat the solution to evaporate water, allow it to cool for crystallisation, and finally filter and dry the crystals.",
          "hint": "Review the process of crystallisation: titration for precision, evaporation to remove excess water, cooling for crystal formation, and filtration/drying to purify the crystals."

          "question": "Predict what would happen if iron was added to copper sulfate solution, and explain your answer.",
          "answer": "Iron would displace copper from copper sulfate, forming iron sulfate and depositing copper. This happens because iron is more reactive than copper in the reactivity series.",

          "question": "Which acid is strong and which is weak?",

      "answer": "Magnesium is oxidised because it loses electrons to form Mg²⁺. Hydrogen ions (H⁺) are reduced because they gain electrons to form H₂.",
      "tips": [
        "Always define oxidation as loss of electrons and reduction as gain of electrons",
        "Identify which specific chemical species is oxidized and which is reduced",
        "Use the ionic equation provided to track electron transfer",
        "For full marks, you must explain both oxidation AND reduction correctly",

        "Remember the key distinction: all alkalis are bases, but not all bases are alkalis",

      "tips": [
        "Remember: pH = -log[H⁺]",
        "For pH 2.9, the [H⁺] is approximately 10⁻³ mol/dm³ or 0.001 mol/dm³",
        "Weak acids like ethanoic acid only partially ionize, so [H⁺] will be much less than the acid concentration",
        "For each pH unit difference, the H⁺ concentration changes by a factor of 10"

      "question": "03.3 - Explain why the solution of hydrochloric acid has a different pH to the solution of ethanoic acid.",
      "answer": "Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid that completely ionizes in solution, releasing all its hydrogen ions (H⁺). Ethanoic acid is a weak acid that only partially ionizes, releasing fewer hydrogen ions. This means hydrochloric acid has a higher concentration of H⁺ ions in solution, resulting in a lower pH (pH 1.0) compared to ethanoic acid (pH 2.9), despite both having the same concentration.",
      "tips": [
        "Compare strong acids (complete ionization) vs. weak acids (partial ionization)",
        "Explain how ionization affects hydrogen ion concentration",
        "Link hydrogen ion concentration to pH values",
